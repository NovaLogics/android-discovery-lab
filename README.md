### Units
01: [**First Android App**](https://github.com/NovaLogics/android-discovery-lab/tree/unit/u001-first-android-app)  
In this unit, I created my first Android project using Android Studio. The goal was to familiarize myself with the Android development environment
#

### Experiment Units

#### 01: Kotlin Coroutines
In this unit, I explored Kotlin Coroutines to understand how they simplify asynchronous programming in Android.  

01: [**Kotlin Coroutines**](https://github.com/NovaLogics/android-discovery-lab/tree/expt/s001-u001-kotlin-coroutines)
- Simple Explanation of Kotlin Coroutines | Launching Your First Coroutine

02: [**Suspend Functions**](https://github.com/NovaLogics/android-discovery-lab/tree/expt/s001-u002-suspend-functions) 
- This is especially useful for tasks like network calls or database operations. Explore more >>

03: [**Coroutine Contexts and Dispatchers**](https://github.com/NovaLogics/android-discovery-lab/tree/expt/s001-u003-coroutine-contexts) 
- Dispatchers define the thread or thread pool in which a coroutine runs, allowing us to control where tasks are executed. Explore more >>
